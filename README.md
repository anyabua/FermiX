Fermi cross-correlations

Repository containing all the code written up for my project. 

Crosscorr.py is the code given to Glamdring, the Oxford computer cluster to compute the power spectrum of gamma ray map data from FermiLAT and galaxy clustering maps as well as the associated jackknife errors. 

The notebook is the code written to plot these data points with the errors as well as code written up to analyse the plots and data along with theoretical models. A lot of what is in the notebook is still a work in progress.
