This repository containts the F and emissivity measuremnets, as well as example notebooks on its usage, from its companion paper "DARK MATTER CONSTRAINTS FROM TOMOGRAPHIC GAMMA-RAY CROSS-CORRELATIONS." The paper uses these F measurements extracted from raw cross-correlations to obtain constraints on the velocity-averaged annihilation rate and the decay rate for dark matter annihilation and decay repsectively. 

In this repository you will find: 

## The data folder
This folder contains 4 data files: the F measurements for the case of annihliation in three different substructure reigmes (SC14, M16, G12), decay, and emissivity measurements.

## Notebooks
The notebooks (Fmeasurements_example.ipynb and Astrohysical_example.ipynb) accompanies the data folder by showing the user how to extract information from the data files. The supplementary notebooks (Extracting_F_from_Cls_Annihilation/Decay.ipynb) shows how these F measurements were obtained from our raw gamma-ray cross-correlations.
