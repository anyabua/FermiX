# FermiX

This repository contains the F and astrophysical emissivity measurements, as well as example notebooks on its usage, from its companion paper "[Constraints on dark matter and astrophysics from tomographic $\gamma$-ray cross-correlations]"(https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14881). Both quantities, F and the astroyphysical emissivity, are defined in Section II D 3 and Section II E of the paper respectively. The F measurements extracted from the raw cross-correlations have been used in the paper to put constraints on the velocity-averaged annihilation rate  $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ and the decay rate $\Gamma$ for dark matter annihilation and decay respectively. The astrophysical emissivity measurements have been used to put constraints on the energy and redshift dependence of the detected $\gamma$-ray emissivity without assuming a particular origin.

In this repository you will find: 

## The data folder
[This folder](data) contains 4 data files: the F measurements for the case of annihliation in three different substructure reigmes (SC14, M16, G12), decay, and emissivity measurements.


## Notebooks
The notebooks [Astrophysical_example](/Astrophysical_example.ipynb) and [Fmeasurements_example](/Fmeasurements_example.ipynb) accompanies the data folder by showing the user how to extract information from the data files. The supplementary notebooks [Extracting_F_from_Cls_Decay](/Extracting_F_from_Cls_Decay.ipynb) and [Extracting_F_from_Cls_Annihilation](/Extracting_F_from_Cls_Annihilation.ipynb) shows how these F measurements were obtained from our raw gamma-ray cross-correlations.
