# FermiX

This repository containts the F and astrophysical emissivity measurements, as well as example notebooks on its usage, from its companion paper "Constraints on dark matter and astrophysics from tomographic $\gamma$-ray cross-correlations." Both quantities (F and the astroyphysical emissivity) are defined in Section II D 3. The paper uses these F measurements extracted from raw cross-correlations to obtain constraints on the velocity-averaged annihilation rate and the decay rate for dark matter annihilation and decay repsectively. 

In this repository you will find: 

## The data folder
This folder contains 4 data files: the F measurements for the case of annihliation in three different substructure reigmes (SC14, M16, G12), decay, and emissivity measurements.

## Notebooks
The notebooks [Astrophysical_example](FermiX/blob/main/Astrophysical_example.ipynb) and [Fmeasurements_example](FermiX/blob/main/Fmeasurements_example.ipynb) accompanies the data folder by showing the user how to extract information from the data files. The supplementary notebooks [Extracting_F_from_Cls_Decay](FermiX/blob/main/Extracting_F_from_Cls_Decay.ipynb) and [Extracting_F_from_Cls_Annihilation](FermiX/blob/main/Extracting_F_from_Cls_Annihilation.ipynb) shows how these F measurements were obtained from our raw gamma-ray cross-correlations.
