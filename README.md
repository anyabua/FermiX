Fermi cross-correlations

Repository containing all the code written up for my summer internship project. 

Crosscorr.py is the code given to Glamdring, the Oxford computer cluster to compute the power spectrum gamma ray maps and galaxy maps as well as the associated jackknife errors. 

.... is the code written to plot these data points with the errors as well as code written up to analyse the plots and data along with a theoreticla model.
